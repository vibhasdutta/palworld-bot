// Listens on PM2's own event bus for start/stop/restart of any process --
// this fires no matter how it happened (bot-triggered `pm2 restart` call, or
// someone running `pm2 stop palworld` by hand over SSH). `expectedActions`
// filters out the former since that's already reported through the normal
// command/audit-log flow; only genuinely-external events reach `onExternalEvent`.
//
// ponytail: runs inside the bot's own long-lived process rather than as a
// separate watcher process -- simplest option, and reliable for observing
// the *Palworld* process's lifecycle since the bot stays up independently of
// it. The one gap: if the bot's own process is killed externally, there's
// only a best-effort window to report that before the process actually
// dies. A fully robust version would run as its own always-on PM2 app.
